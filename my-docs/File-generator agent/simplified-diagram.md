## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **User Request**: You ask AnythingLLM to create a file with specific content

2. **File Generation**: The microservice receives the request and creates the file (PDF, Word, or Excel)

3. **AI Processing**: If needed, the Dify Agent helps process the content

4. **File Delivery**: AnythingLLM provides a link to download your generated file

That's it! The system handles all the technical details behind the scenes, so you just need to ask for what you want, and you'll get a downloadable file in return.
